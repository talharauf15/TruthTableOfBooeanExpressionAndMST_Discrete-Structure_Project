# TruthTableOfBooeanExpressionAndMST_Discrete-Structure_Project
This project delves into the fundamental concepts of discrete structures, focusing on the construction of Truth Tables for Boolean Expressions and the exploration of Minimum Spanning Trees (MST).
As a combination of logic and graph theory, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these essential concepts within the realm of computer science and mathematics.

1. Truth Table of Boolean Expression:
Unravel the intricacies of Boolean algebra by creating detailed Truth Tables for Boolean Expressions. This segment of the project involves the systematic analysis of logical expressions, breaking them down into their constituent components and exhaustively listing all possible combinations of truth values. The goal is to showcase a clear and organized representation of the logical outcomes, aiding in the understanding of the Boolean logic's behavior.

2. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in Graphs:
Transitioning into graph theory, the project explores the concept of Minimum Spanning Trees. Investigate the most efficient ways to connect vertices in a graph while minimizing the overall edge weights. This section involves the application of algorithms such as Prim's or Kruskal's to identify and construct the Minimum Spanning Tree. Illustrate the step-by-step process of selecting edges to form a tree that spans all the vertices with the least possible total edge weight.

Project Goals and Learning Outcomes:
